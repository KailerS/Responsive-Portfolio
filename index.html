            <p>My name is Kailer Smith. I grew up in Gig Harbor Washington. Since my first 18 years in Washington I have lived in Texas, Illinois, Tennessee, and now Colorado. I graduated from Southern Illinois University Edwardsville with a bachelor degree in business administration. I relized that the sales side of business is not for me and I am excited to pursue a career in the development field.</p>
            <p>My hobbies include soccer, snowboarding, and video games. One big draw of moving to Denver was the ability to snowboard all season. I haven't had the chance to try all the mountains around here but my current favorite mountain is Whistler in B.C. Since my days of playing N64 with my friends my love for video games hasn't faded.</p>
